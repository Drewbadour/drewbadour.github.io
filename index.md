Hi! I'm Drew Mills, the guy behind "Vestigl Creations." I enjoy low level programming, with a focus on C and embedded systems.

I'm passionate about building awesome tools that both developers and users love to use. And I'm passionate about making the most of the incredible hardware we have at our disposal.

## Driver Work

When it comes to driver development, my major contribution is an Xbox controller driver for macOS known as [360Controller][360controller].

I developed the Xbox One controller support for the driver and I have been maintaining, fixing bugs, enhancing features, and adding third party controllers since 2015.

Before 360Controller, I built [Xone-OSX][xone-osx] in 2014 to support Xbox One controllers. Integrating into 360Controller ended up being the better choice for everyone, so that driver was quickly integrated into 360Controller.

## Embedded Work

Computers are insanely fast, and I frequently find myself frustrated with how slow modern software is, despite this fact. Because of this, I've focused on low-level programming to help make the most of the incredible hardware at our fingertips. Because of this, I love the challenge of embedded systems development, and I would love to contribute to game consoles, controllers, and even HMD development.

In the meantime, I run a company called [Beyond HMI][beyhmi], which develops embedded systems for the automation industry.

## Keyboard Work

As a programmer, I'm pretty passionate about my tools. Naturally, as they are embedded systems, I love working on them. If you're here because you're passionate about keyboards, you probably know me for bringing electrostatic capacitive keyboards into the custom keyboard scene. Or just as the inventor of Dopre.

## Let's Talk
